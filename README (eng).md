# ✈️ Fullstack Web Project - **Travel agency - Fligh**

---

This project was created as a **semester assignment** during my studies at University of Žilina in the Multimedia Technologies. <br/>
The goal was to develop a **complete web application**, including custom UI design, an interactive front-end, and server-side logic with **Node.js**. <br/>
During the project, I also explored the basics of **AJAX** (fetch API), which i used to load data from the server withoud refreshing the page. <br/>
